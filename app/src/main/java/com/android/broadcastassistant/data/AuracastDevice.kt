/**
 * Represents a discovered Auracast broadcaster device.
 *
 * Each device may advertise one or more BIS (Broadcast Isochronous Stream) channels.
 * This class holds both the discovery metadata (name, address, RSSI) and parsed BIS details.
 *
 * Equality is defined based on all fields including [bisChannels] and [broadcastCode].
 *
 * @property name Human-readable name (e.g., venue, source).
 * @property address BLE MAC address.
 * @property rssi Signal strength of the scan result.
 * @property bisChannels List of available BIS channels on this device.
 * @property selectedBisIndex Index of the currently selected BIS channel (-1 if none).
 * @property broadcastId Optional 24-bit broadcast identifier (unique per transmitter).
 * @property broadcastCode Optional raw bytes for encrypted broadcasts.
 * @property sourceId ID assigned by the Broadcast Receive State characteristic (needed for BASS control).
